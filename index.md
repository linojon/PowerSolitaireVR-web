# [](#header-1)About the Game
Ordinary solitaire card games are fun, relaxing and a great office time-waster. Playing in virtual reality is even better!

MULTIPLAYER MODE: But wait, there's more! Multiplayer Power Solitaire is fast and competitive. It’s immersive, 
it’s social, and it’s a ton of fun! In this unique 2 or more player variation, you race to use your competitors' 
foundation piles and compete to finish first. Play your cards onto anyone's piles, if you can beat them to it. 
The action escalates quickly, becoming fast and competitive. Not your father's solitaire! 

This is a seated (or standing) VR experience.
